# Organize Downloads

This is a simple automation script built to help organize downloaded files into different folders. The purpose of this project is not to create something groundbreaking, but to improve my skills with Python, automation, and file management.

## Overview

After running this script, files in the download directory will be sorted and moved into specific folders based on file type or other criteria. This prevents the clutter of having all files in one "Downloads" folder, making it easier to find and manage files. While this is a simple tool, it was a valuable project for learning and gaining hands-on experience in automation and scripting with Python.

## How It Works

1. The script identifies files in your Downloads folder.
2. Based on the file extension (or other criteria), it moves files into designated folders. For example:
   - `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg` → `Images`
   - `.mp3` → `Audio`
   - `.epub` → `Books`

## Objectives

- Learn the basics of automation and scripting.
- Practice file and folder management with Python.
- Gain experience with Python libraries for handling files and directories.
